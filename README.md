Cautions : When you initialize a AVLTree, you should specify the key type and the value type
           like new AVLTree<Iteger, String>(Comparator), the key must be unique. You need to
           define a class which implements  Comparator to determine the order of key type.
           It is OK to modify this code for your own intent.
